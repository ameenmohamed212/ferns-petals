# 🎁 E-Commerce Sales Analytics: Gift Shop Performance Dashboard
## 📌 Project Overview
This project features a comprehensive end-to-end sales analysis for a retail gift platform (fnp.sg). Using Excel, I transformed raw transactional data into an interactive visual dashboard to track key performance indicators (KPIs), identify seasonal sales trends, and analyze customer purchasing behavior across different regions and gift occasions.

## 🛠️ Technical Skill Set
Data Processing: Cleaned and organized large datasets using Excel Pivot Tables to aggregate revenue and order counts.

Analytical Metrics: Calculated essential business KPIs including Total Revenue ($3.52M), Average Delivery Time (5.53 Days), and Average Customer Spend ($3,520.98).

Advanced Visualizations: Designed an interactive dashboard featuring Line Charts for trend analysis, Bar Charts for categorical comparisons, and Slicers for dynamic filtering.

Time Intelligence: Analyzed sales volume by month and even by hour of the day to identify peak ordering times.

## 📊 Business Insights Delivered
Seasonal Trends: Identified major revenue spikes in February and August, correlating with peak gift-giving seasons.

Occasion Analysis: Segmented revenue by occasions such as Anniversaries, Valentine's Day, and Raksha Bandhan, identifying 'Anniversaries' as a top revenue driver.

Geographic Performance: Ranked the Top 10 Cities by order volume (e.g., Bareilly, Ghaziabad) to optimize regional marketing efforts.

Product Strategy: Analyzed performance across categories like Sweets, Soft Toys, and Plants to determine inventory priority.

Operational Efficiency: Monitored delivery performance to ensure a consistent average lead time of ~5.5 days.
